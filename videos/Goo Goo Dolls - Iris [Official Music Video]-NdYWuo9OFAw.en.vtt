00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.700
And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:30.380
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever
be And I don't want to go home right now

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.100
And all I can taste is this moment

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.160
And all I can breathe is your life

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.820
And sooner or later it's over

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.000
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.460
And I don't want the world to see me

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.360
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.400
When everything's made to be broken

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.060
I just want you to know who I am

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:19.660
INSTRUMENTATION

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.160
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.820
Or the moment of truth in your lies

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.720
When everything feels like the movies

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.720
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.300
And I don't want the world to see me

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.020
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.440
When everything's made to be broken

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.540
I just want you to know who I am

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:54.400
INSTRUMENTATION

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.900
And I don't want the world to see me

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.760
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.860
When everything's made to be broken

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.540
I just want you to know who I am

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.000
I just want you to know who I am

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.080
I just want you to know who I am
