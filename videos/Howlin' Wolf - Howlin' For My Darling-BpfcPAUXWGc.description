Chester Arthur Burnett (June 10, 1910 -- January 10, 1976), known as Howlin' Wolf, was an influential American blues singer, guitarist and harmonica player. He was born in West Point, Mississippi in an area now known as White Station.
With a booming voice and looming physical presence, Burnett is commonly ranked among the leading performers in electric blues; musician and critic Cub Koda declared, "no one could match Howlin' Wolf for the singular ability to rock the house down to the foundation while simultaneously scaring its patrons out of its wits." A number of songs written or popularized by Burnettâ€”such as "Smokestack Lightnin'", "Back Door Man", "Killing Floor" and "Spoonful"â€”have become blues and blues rock standards.
